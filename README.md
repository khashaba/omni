# OmniChallenge

This project is made for omni:us front end challenge

 
## Note

 - The project has a lot of flows but it's just proof of concept. I
   didn't follow the best practices in many cases but I did it because I
   was just trying to implement the functionality in both ways.
- Validation is not applied in many cases
- Pagination is made in the front end , I didn't apply server pagination because it's not stated that i should build the api
- Table component has many component that could be a separate component but i didn't separated them.
- I didn't use any styling framwork which is very time consuming
